Used for Qcom 1.6 com log files to overcome the order mismatch of the RX and TX from UGP V7 code. Running this code will put the code in the expected order and out put the resulting log file. 
Not the most efficent code but is only required occasionally. It is expected a fix will be placed in the platform that will store in the correct order.
